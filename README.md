# Rogue Scavenger

<p>This is a passion project and a work in progress.</p> 
<p> As a rogue scavenger you find yourself in many unknown places looking for scraps of forgotten treasure. Today you find yourself in a temple lost to time. It was a difficult journey to get this far and it looks like gathering all the tresure here is going to be just as difficult...</p>

# The Initial Idea
<p>As a way to motivate myself to code one day I decided to make the first interesting thing that came to mind. On that day it was a game in JavaScript. I decided I was going to be a 2D platformer built from the ground up without using any libraries (such as Phaser) with nothing but JavaScript/HTML written all by yours truly (with help from the internet of course). This was a way to flex my logic muscles in a way tradition web-development hadn't done for me. To date it has been one of my most creatively inspiring projects and as of writing this is still in development (1/16/2020).
